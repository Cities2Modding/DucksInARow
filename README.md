# DucksInARow Mod for Cities Skylines 2

## Overview
Welcome to the "DucksInARow" mod for Cities Skylines 2! This is the initial release (v0.0.1) of a mod designed to enhance your city-building experience by adding advanced prop placement options.

### Features
- **Toggle Options for Line Placement of Props**: Allows for the linear arrangement of props with a default spacing of 8 meters.
- **Tree Placement Logic**: When placing trees (e.g., tree A followed by tree B), the mod attempts to distribute trees evenly along a line. However, due to the game's inherent placement logic, results may vary.
- **No UI Yet**: Currently, the mod lacks a user interface, but you can monitor its output through the console log.
- **Dependency**: Requires BepInEx5 for proper functionality.

### Key Shortcuts
- **LEFT SHIFT**: While using the tree placement tool, toggles the mod's functionality on or off.
- **UP ARROW/DOWN ARROW**: Increments or decrements the spacing between props by meters.

## Installation
Ensure you have BepInEx5 installed in your Cities Skylines 2 game. Download and install the "DucksInARow" mod either through the official GitHub repository or via Thunderstore.io.

## Usage
1. Activate the tree placement tool in Cities Skylines 2.
2. Use the LEFT SHIFT key to toggle the mod's functionality.
3. Place your trees and adjust spacing using the UP and DOWN arrows.

## Important Notes
- **Experimental Nature**: This mod is currently in its experimental phase and quite rudimentary.
- **Official Downloads**: To ensure safety and functionality, only download this mod from Thunderstore.io or this official GitHub page.
- **Community Effort**: This mod is a proud creation of the Cities 2 Modding community.

## Disclaimer
While we strive for accuracy in prop placement, due to the inherent logic of Cities Skylines 2, results are not always guaranteed. This mod is under continuous development, and feedback is greatly appreciated.
